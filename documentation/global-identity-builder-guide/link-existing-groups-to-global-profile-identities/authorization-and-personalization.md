# Authorization and Personalization

Many client applications that leverage LDAP directories for authentication and a policy information point, rely on group memberships for enforcing authorization and personalization.

This chapter describes how to virtualize existing static groups from backend directories and define the remapping needed so the group member DNs are remapped to the identities in the global profile. Creating a global profile of identities is described in the chapters [Concepts](#concepts), [Create Projects](#create-projects), [Manual Identity Administration](#manual-identity-administration), and [Persistent Cache with Real-Time Refresh](#persistent-cache-with-real-time-refresh).
