# Identity Correlation

Identity Correlation is the process of linking overlapping users based on correlation rules. Once linked, the entries are joined into a global profile and a union is created by RadiantOne.

>Once identities are linked in the global profile, they remain linked forever unless the identity is deleted from a data source or an administrator [manually unlinks](#identity-unlinking) them.
