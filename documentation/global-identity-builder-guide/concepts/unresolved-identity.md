# Unresolved Identity

An unresolved identity is one that either did not match a global profile identity, or matched more than one identity in the global profile based on the correlation rules defined for the identity source.

Unresolved identities do not automatically appear in the global profile view (unless you've configured otherwise in your correlation rules). An administrator can [manually link](#manual-identity-administration) these identities to a global profile identity, or choose to have the identity become a new, unique identity in the global profile.
