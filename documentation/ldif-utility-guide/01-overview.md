-	To determine if a persistent cache is out of sync from backends by comparing LDIF files created from the persistent cache contents, see [Chapter 3: Determining if Persistent Cache is Out of Sync](03-determining-if-persistent-cache-is-out-of-sync). 

-	To verify uniqueness of attribute values in an LDIF file, see [Chapter 4: Testing Attribute Uniqueness](04-testing-attribute-uniqueness).
