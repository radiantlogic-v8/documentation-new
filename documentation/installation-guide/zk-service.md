## Configuring ZooKeeper to Startup as a Service

Use the native operating system utilities (Task Scheduler or Linux Daemons) to configure the ZooKeeper service on each node in the ensemble so that it starts up automatically after reboot.

The script to start ZooKeeper is <ZooKeeper_HOME>\bin\start_zookeeper.bat/.sh.

Scripts to install ZooKeeper as a service can be found here: https://radiantlogicinc246.sharefile.com/d-s7661e751505c433cb66f12d1c471de5c
