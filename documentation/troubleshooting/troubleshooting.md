description: Learn basic troubleshooting techniques for RadiantOne Identity Data Management
---

## Overview

RadiantOne uses the log4J v2 API for logging. Although a variety of log files are generated by RadiantOne, the ones most useful for troubleshooting are associated with RadiantOne LDAP, SCIM and REST APIs, Control Panel, Zookeeper, the real-time persistent cache refresh and synchornization components: Connectors, Sync Engine and Agents.

## Managing Log Levels
There are different levels of logging available for the components. The options are: Off, Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, and Trace.
Log levels are configured from Classic Control Panel > Settings > Logs > Log Settings.

**Off**

Logging is turned off completely for the server.

**Fatal**

Logs events that may cause the RadiantOne service to not be able to respond.  An example would be if a single client was using all threads and the RadiantOne service could not respond to anyone else but this client.

**Error**

Logs any error message encountered by RadiantOne (database connection problems, fatal errors…etc.).

**Warn**

Logs any warning messages encountered by RadiantOne (client disconnected before response could be sent, and errors, fatal messages…etc.).

**Info**

**Logs all access to RadiantOne.  All actions taken by RadiantOne and the results (including warnings, errors, and fatal messages).

**Debug**

Logs very detailed information about the actions taken by RadiantOne.

**Trace**

This log level is relevant only for the Radiant Logic development team to understand problems and is used for intensive troubleshooting.

## Understanding Logs

To ensure optimal performance, the logging for RadiantOne should be reduced to the minimum level that meets your auditing needs for production environments. The log settings that should be considered are configured in the Classic Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Log Settings and Access Logs sub-sections. 


### LDAP Client Activity

In the Classic Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Log Settings section, select VDS – Server from the drop-down list. The RadiantOne service log level, rollover size and how many files to keep archived are defined here. To turn off logging, set Log Level to OFF. The RadiantOne service does not need to be restarted when changing the log level unless you set it to OFF.

### SCIM Client Activity

In the Classic Control Panel > Settings Tab > Logs section > Log Settings section, select VDS – SCIM from the drop-down list. The RadiantOne SCIM acccess log level is defined here. To turn off logging, set Log Level to OFF. The RadiantOne service does not need to be restarted when changing the log level unless you set it to OFF.


### Rest (ADAP) Client Activity



### Control Panel
There are two log files applicable to the Control Panel. 
- The Server Log contains internal server activities and is generated the first time each day that the application hosting the Control Panel is started.
- The Access Log contains the save operations performed by administrators.

**Server Log**

The log file is web.log. 

This file rolls over when it reaches 100M in size and 5 files are archived. These settings are configured from the Classic Control Panel > Settings tab > Logs > Log Settings section. Select Control Panel – Server from the Log Settings to Configure drop-down list. Define the log level, rollover size and number of files to keep archived.

Web.log can be viewed from Environment Operations Center > Environments > Selected Environment > LOGS. 


**Access Log**

The Control Panel access log file contains the save operations performed by administrators. When any user that is a member of the delegated administration groups saves changes in the Control Panel, this activity is logged into the web_access log. This is a CSV formatted log file with the delimiter being <TAB>. These settings are configured from the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Logs > Log Settings section. Select Control Panel – Access from the Log Settings to Configure drop-down list. Define the log level, rollover size and number of files to keep archived.

### Environment Operations Center


### Secure Data Connectors

### Synchronization
The components described in this section are applicable to the RadiantOne Synchronization capability. The high-level diagram below depicts the components involved.

Figure 5.1: Sync Architecture

If the virtual view of the source is configured in persistent cache, the default HDAP trigger method is used to detect and publish the change (detailed in 1b in the diagram). If the virtual view of the source is not configured in persistent cache, the capture connector detects changes directly on the source. In this case, the agent manages the connector (detailed in 1a in the diagram).

**Agent**

The Agent manages the capture connectors. The agent log file agent_fid_sd_agent_real_time.log on the RadiantOne node where the sync agent is running. You can view and download this log file from the Server Control Panel > Log Viewer.

This log file provides details about the state of capture connectors (e.g. started). An example of the kind of message you can find in this log:

```
2021-12-14T08:26:22,853 INFO  com.rli.cragents.orchestrator.client.e:80 - [SyncWorker-agent_W-RLI21-LGRADY_fid_sd_agent__real_time_PID_2472] Connector started for o_activedirectory_sync_ou_testing_o_companydirectory_pipeline_o_activedirectory.
```

The log level is controlled by the setting in Classic Control Panel -> Settings tab -> Logs -> Log Settings. Select the Sync Agents – Agents option.

**Connectors**

Capture connectors log activity to <piplelineId>\connector.log on the RadiantOne node where the sync agent is running. You can view and download this log file from the Server Control Panel > Log Viewer.
 
1.	The log level is defined per connector with the setting in Main Control Panel > Global Sync tab. 

2.	Select the topology and click Configure next to the relevant pipeline. 

3.	Click the Capture component and expand the Advanced Properties section.

4.	Locate the Log Level property and select the level from the drop-down list.

5.	Click **Save**.

**Sync Engine (Transformation and Apply)**

The Sync Engine processes the transformations and sends the changes to the destination. These activities are logged in sync_engine.log on the RadiantOne node where the sync engine processor that is assigned for the pipeline is running. You can view and download sync_engine.log from the Server Control Panel > Log Viewer.  You can also use the Classic Control Panel > Synchronization tab by selecting the topology and clicking Configure next to the pipeline. Select the Apply component and in the Log Viewer section, click Download.

An example of transformation and apply activities that you can find in this log are shown below. Important information is highlighted in <span style="color:red">red</span>.
