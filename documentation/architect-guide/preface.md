# Preface

## About this Manual

The focus of this guide is to:

- Introduce the different challenges that the RadiantOne platform addresses.
- Introduce ways to architect the solution while taking into account specific security requirements for authentication and authorization.

This guide is primarily for architects in charge of designing the solution to match the use case at hand. Although this document would be a valuable introduction for a RadiantOne administrator, it does not describe any step-by-step configuration details. This type of information is detailed in [Configuration](/sys-admin-guide/01-introduction) and [Namespace Design](/namespace-configuration-guide/01-introduction).

References to other relevant RadiantOne documentation are included throughout this guide.

## Audience

This manual is written with the assumption that the reader is familiar with the following LDAP and relational database terminology and concepts:

- LDAP
- SQL
- General knowledge regarding the structure of a directory information tree (DIT)
