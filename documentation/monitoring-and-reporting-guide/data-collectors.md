description: Data Collectors that can be used for monitoring and custom alerts
---

## Data Collectors

RadiantOne offers data collectors associated with various functions within the service. These data collectors can be used to configure custom alerts.

The names of data collectors are shown below.

![An image showing ](Media/Image1.26.jpg)

Figure 1. 26 : Data Collectors

Descriptions for each data collector can be found in the following sections. Some properties
within data collectors require the RadiantOne service to be running to get status information.
Each description in this section indicates if the RadiantOne service needs to be running. If you
have configured custom alerts that use properties in a data collector that require the
RadiantOne service to be running, and the service stops, no alerts are sent. Be mindful of this
when using data collectors in custom alerts.

### Active-alerts

The active-alerts data collector returns information about all active alerts that are currently
triggered. If the response is empty, this means there are currently no alerts triggered.

>[!note] This data collector does not require a RadiantOne service to be running to return status information.

This is calculated by finding the difference between the vdsSyncCursor on the domain on the target cluster and the number of changes in the replication journal for that domain that weren't applied by that cluster.
- ensurePush – a value of true indicates that Ensured Push Mode is enabled for the replicated domain. A value of false indicates that Ensured Push Mode is not enabled for the replicated domain.

>[!note] This data collector requires the RadiantOne service to be running to return information.

**Real-time Persistent Cache Refresh**

A high-level real-time persistent cache refresh architecture is shown below.

![An image showing ](Media/Image1.39.jpg)

Figure 1.39 : Real-time Persistent Cache Refresh Architecture

Pipeline properties for real-time persistent cache refresh processes are described below.

- SourceDn and targetDn values are the same, and indicate the DN in the RadiantOne namespace that is configured for real-time persistent cache refresh.
- The pipelineId is the identifier associated with the real-time persistent cache refresh.
- The pipelineType value is: PCACHE
- The componentType has one of the following values: APPLY, CAPTURE, PIPELINE, PROCESSOR.
- The CAPTURE componentType, related to step 1 in Figure 1.30, has the following properties (propertyId): captureCounter, captureHostname, captureMetaDn, captureState, captureType.
<br> *captureCounter* - indicates the number of changed entries published by the connector.
<br> *captureHostname* - indicates the identifier of the machine where the agent process is running. The agent oversees managing the connector states.
<br> *captureMetaDn* - is an identifier for the virtual node that the connector listens for changes on.
<br> *captureState* - is the status of the capture connector. The captureState can have one of the following values: RUNNING, DEPLOYING, STOPPED, ERROR, WAITING_FOR_AGENT.

- The PROCESSOR componentType has the following properties: processorCounter, processorHostname, processorQueueSize. The processor component logic is built into the Sync Engine shown in Figure 1.30 and is responsible for processing events from the queues. ProcessorCounter is the number of events processed from the queue. ProcessorHostname is the machine name where this process is running. ProcessorQueueSize is the number of entries in the queue waiting to be processed. ProcessorQueueSize is a good candidate to configure custom alertsfor. If this number is growing, and the pipeline is fully  started, it is an indicator that events are being processed too slow. This could be due to errors while applying events, or just slow machine hardware or network.

- The PIPELINE componentType has the following property (propertyId): pipelineState, which indicates if the synchronization process is started. PipelineState can have one of the following values: RUNNING, SUSPENDED, UPLOADING, ERROR, DEPLOYING, WAITING_FOR_AGENT
- The PROCESSOR componentType, has the following properties (propertyId): processorCounter, processorHostname, processorQueueSize. The processor component logic is built into the Sync Engine shown in Figure 1.31 and is responsible for processing events from the queues. ProcessorCounter is the number of events processed from the queue. ProcessorHostname is the machine name where this process is running. ProcessorQueueSize is the number of entries in the queue waiting to be processed. ProcessorQueueSize is a good candidate to configure custom alerts for. If this number is growing, and the pipeline is fully started, it is an indicator that events are being processed too slow.

- opThreadPoolSizePeak – Peak number of working threads.
- opWaitingInQueue – Number of operations in the queue waiting to be processed.
- waitingRatio - The ratio of threads that are waiting to be executed (opWaitingInQueue) to the thread pool max size (opThreadPoolSizeMax).
