# Alert Management

Custom alerts can be created in Environment Operations Center to help your teams monitor the health and operations of your environments. Once created, alerts are sent to your specified communication channels to keep you up to date on important changes, potential issues, or errors. This guide outlines the steps to create and manage alerts in Environment Operations Center.

>[!note]An integration channel to receive the alert must be created prior to setting up the alert. For details on adding communication channel integrations, see the [integrations](../integrations/manage-integrations.md) guide.

## Getting started

Navigate to the *Alerts* tab in the *Environments* section of environment operations center. From this tab, you can add new environment monitoring alerts and manage existing alerts.
