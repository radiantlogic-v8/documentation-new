# Chapter 1: Overview

RadiantOne includes a set of wizards and tools to assist administrators with some of the most common configuration tasks. This includes tasks such as building a unique user list, handling group entries (migrate them or create dynamic groups), and designing the namespace (flat tree or merge into an existing hierarchy). Each wizard is tailored for specific use cases, depending on the needs of the applications that will be consuming RadiantOne. 

The wizards are launched from the Wizards Tab in the Main Control Panel. The RadiantOne service must be running prior to launching a wizard and can be started from the Dashboard tab in the Main Control Panel (or as a service) if needed.
