## Creating Identity Views

There are two main design approaches to creating identity views.
 1. Using an [LDAP proxy approach](ldap-proxy-views.md), where the identity view deployed in RadiantOne represents an exact hierarchy (or specific sub-branch) of an existing LDAP directory data source. With this view design approach you are limited to the exact hierarchical structure of the existing directory store backend. However, you can choose to include or exclude specific branches to limit the data in the identity view.
 2. Using a model-driven approach, where the identity view deployed in RadiantOne can be designed based on the metadata extracted from existing identity sources. With this view design approach you have infinite flexibility and can create flat views, or very complex hierarchies based on the objects and attributes from each identity source. Use the model-driven approach to create identity views from LDAP, JDBC-accessible data sources and Custom data sources.

A special type of identity view that leverages the model-driven design approach is generated by the Global Identity Builder tool. This tool can be used to address two commmon identity data challenges:
- No single identity source containing all user accounts. This means integrating with multiple identity sources containing various levels of overlapping user accounts. The Global Identity Builder generates an identity view that provides a unique reference list of user accounts, joining overlapping ones as needed.
- Multiple identity sources containing 100% overlapping user accounts without a single attribute to uniquely identify the overlap. The Global Identity Builder generates an identity view that provides a unique reference list of user accounts, joining overlapping ones based on one or more cascading matching rules. Each pair of identity sources can have their own list of matching rules, allowing identity architects to address a variety of complex data quality challenges (e.g. Sources A, B and C have overlapping identities that can be identified by their Employee Name + Department Name + Last 4 characters of Employee ID, if there is no match found, check Location + Last 4 characters of Employee ID + Login Name).

For more details, see [Global Identity Builder](../global-identity-builder/introduction).

Every Root Naming Context configured in the RadiantOne namespace can be active or inactive.
There is a toggle to indicate whether the naming context is active or not. Toggle it off to deactivate the naming context. Only active naming contexts are accessible in RadiantOne by clients.
