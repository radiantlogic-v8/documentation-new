description: Learn how to manage client certificates.

## Overview

For RadiantOne to connect via SSL to an underlying data source, or accept client certificates for authentication, the appropriate client certificate needs imported (unless they are signed by a trusted/known Certificate Authority). For classic RadiantOne architectures (active/active or active/passive), these certificates can be imported into the default Java trust store (<RLI_HOME>\jdk\jre\lib\security\cacerts). 

>[!warning] 
>If RadiantOne is deployed in a cluster, import the client certificates into the [cluster level truststore](client-certificate-trust-store#client-certificate-trust-store-cluster-level-trust-store) instead of the default one so they can be dynamically shared across all cluster nodes.

To manage the client certificates contained in the default Java trust store, click **Manage** next to the Client Certificates property.
