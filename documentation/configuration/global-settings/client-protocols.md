### Supported Controls
LDAP controls, as documented in [RFC 2251](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2251.html), offer clients and directory services a mechanism for extending an LDAP operation. 
A client can use a control to specify additional information as part of a request. For example, a client can send a control to a server as part of a search request to indicate that the server should sort the search results before sending the results back to the client. A directory service can return a control in an LDAP operation response to provide additional information to a client. For example, a directory service can send a control in a client bind response to indicate that a password is about to expire. The client could then prompt the user to update their password.
