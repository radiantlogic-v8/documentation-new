## Overview

A global join is a universal join condition that applies to all Root Naming Contexts configured in the RadiantOne service. If you have the need to extend all identity views with the same attributes from the same secondary sources, a global join is more efficient than configuring the join at each Root Naming Context level.  Global joins are configured from Classic Control Panel > Settings > Interception > Global External Joins. To switch to Classic Control Panel, use the menu options for the logged in user in the upper right.

A global interception script is a "hook" that applies to all Root Naming Contexts configured in the RadiantOne service. If you have the need to extend all identity views with the same interception script capabilities, a global interception is more efficient than configuring an interception script at the identity view levels.
