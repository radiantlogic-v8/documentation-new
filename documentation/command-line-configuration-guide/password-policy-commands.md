# Password Policy Commands

Password policies are managed from the Main Control Panel, Settings tab, Security section, Password Policies, and can also be managed using the REST API.

![password policy commands](Media/Image13.1.jpg)

This chapter explains how to add, update, and remove a password policy using the REST API instead of the GUI mentioned above.

## print-pwd-policy

This command prints the current settings for a given password policy.

**Usage:**
<br>`print-pwd-policy -name <name> [-instance <instance>]`

**Command Arguments:**

**`- name <name>`**
<br>[required] The password policy name. Use the value 'default' to refer to the default password policy.

**`- instance <instance>`**
<br>The name of the RadiantOne instance. If not specified, the default instance named vds_server is used.

**REST (ADAP) Example**
In the following example, a request is made to display the settings for the default password policy.

```
https://<rli_server_name>:8090/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&commandname=print-pwd-policy&name=default
```

## add-pwd-policy

This command adds a new custom password policy.

**Usage:**
