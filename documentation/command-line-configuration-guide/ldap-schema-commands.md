# LDAP Schema Commands

The RadiantOne LDAP schema can be extended with objects and attributes defined in a schema/orx file from the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Configuration section > ORX Schema and can also be managed from REST API.

This chapter covers publishing and removing an ORXâ€™s schema from the RadiantOne LDAP schema using commands through the REST API instead of the GUI mentioned above.

## add-orx-schema

This command publishes/adds objects and attributes from a given ORX file to the RadiantOne LDAP schema.

**Usage:**
<br>`add-orx-schema -name <name> [-instance <instance>] [-ldap]`

**Command Arguments:**

**`- name <name>`**
<br>[required] The ORX name (must be an existing ORX file).

**`- instance <instance>`**
<br>The name of the RadiantOne instance. If not specified, the default instance named vds_server is used.

**`- ldap`**
<br>Indicates that the ORX name is an LDAP Schema, found in the 'lod' folder. If this option is not specified, the tool looks for the ORX in the 'org' folder.
