# Monitoring and Alert Settings Commands

Monitoring and alert settings are managed from the Main Control Panel > Settings tab > Monitoring section and can also be managed using the REST API.

![Monitoring an Alert Settings Commands ](Media/Image15.1.jpg)

This chapter explains how to manage alerts and email alert settings using commands instead of the GUI mentioned above.

## list-alerts

This command displays all alerts that are configured. An example of the default configuration for disk usage alert is shown below.

>This command does not support output format configuration. Refer to [Configuring Command Output Format](introduction.md#configuring-command-output-format) for more information.

**REST (ADAP) Example**

In the following example, a request is made to display all configured alerts.

```
https://<rli_server_name>:8090/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&commandname=list-alerts
```

## new-alert

This command allows you to configure a new alert.

>[!note]
>This command does not support output format configuration. Refer to [Configuring Command Output Format](introduction.md#configuring-command-output-format) for more information.

An example of creating an alert that returns the information from the node-monitor data collector for a given node is: vdsconfig.bat new-alert -d node-monitor -p nodeId:4ef6b4c3-a56f-4cd0- 853f-b054c5e851a3 -t not-equals -g isVdsRunning:false -i 60 -e true -n "My Custom Alert" -o FileAlert,EmailAlert

**Usage:**
<br>`new-alert -d <data collector key> [-p <data property>] -t <trigger type> [-g <key:value>] - i <seconds> [-e <enabled>] [-n <alert name>] [-o <output type>] [-m <alert message>]`

**Command Arguments:**

**`- d <data collector key>`**
<br>This indicates the data collector that returns the information needed for your monitoring needs. The possible values are: active-alerts, cloud-replication, cluster-info, cluster-latency, cluster- ldap, cluster-zk, connections-info, datasource-status, event-log, hdap-store, pipeline, node-info, node-monitor, node-status, process-info, server-event. For details on each data collector, see the [RadiantOne Monitoring and Reporting Guide](/documentation/monitoring-and-reporting-guide/01-monitoring).

**`- p <data property>`**
<br>Indicates the property to collect. Each data collector returns different properties. For details on possible properties for each data collector, see the [RadiantOne Monitoring and Reporting Guide](/documentation/monitoring-and-reporting-guide/01-monitoring).

**`- t <trigger type>`**
<br>This indicates the type of trigger that activates the alert. The possible values are: above, always, below, equals, or not-equals.

**`- g <key:value>`**
<br>This indicates the trigger parameter. An example is: -g isVdsRunning:false which means the
RadiantOne service is not running and this could be a condition to trigger an alert.

**`- i <seconds>`**
<br>This is the monitoring polling interval in seconds.

**`- e <enabled>`**
<br>This indicates if the alert is active or not. A value of true indicates it is active. A value of false
indicates it is not active.

**`- n <alert name>`**
<br>The name of the alert. This value must be unique across all alerts.

**`- o <output type>`**
<br>This indicates if the output is a file and/or email. Use a value of FileAlert if you want the output to be a file. Use a value of EmailAlert if you want the output to be an email. For both output types, use: -o FileAlert,EmailAlert

**`- m <alert message> `**
<br>This indicates the message to include in the alert. An example would be: -m "RadiantOne is not running on node 4ef6b4c3-a56f-4cd0-853f-b054c5e851a3".

**REST (ADAP) Example**

In the following example, a request is made to create a custom alert for when the state of the RadiantOne on a given node changes (e.g. changes from started to stopped).

```
https://<rli_server_name>:8090/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&commandname=new-alert&d=node-monitor&t=not-equals&g=isVdsRunning:false&i=60&e=true&n="My CustomAlert"&o=FileAlert,EmailAlert&p=nodeId:a9251b17-151c-45ed-a70a-2d3afc614743
```
