Details of the logging property keys and paths to the configuration can be seen from the ZooKeeper tab.

This chapter explains how to display and update log settings using the REST API instead of the GUI mentioned above.

## get-logging-property

This command displays a logging configuration property.

**Usage:**
<br>`get-logging-property -key <key> -path <path> [-instance <instance>]`

**Command Arguments:**

**` - key <key>`**
<br>[required] The logging property key. Examples of logging property keys for RadiantOne are: server.log.level, server.log.file, and server.log.file.archive. The logging property key names can be seen from the ZooKeeper tab in the Main Control Panel as described above.

**`- path <path>`**
<br>[required] The path to the logging configuration. Examples of the path to the logging configuration are:

For RadiantOne: zk:log4j2-vds.json

For Control Panel: zk:log4j2-control-panel.json

**`- instance <instance>`**
<br>The name of the RadiantOne instance. If not specified, the default instance named vds_server is used.

**REST (ADAP) Example**

In the following example, a request is made to display the value for the maximum size of the access log file.

```
https://<rli_server_name>:8090/adap/util?action=vdsconfig&commandname=get-logging-property&key=access.log.file.maxSize&path=zk:log4j2-vds.json
```

```

## merge-logging-conf

This command performs a merge of two logging configurations.

**Usage:**

**`- mergepath <mergepath>`**
<br>[required] The path of the JSON-formatted logging configuration to merge with.

>[!note]
>The value for this argument should specify the location of a logging configuration in either the file system (i.e. file:c/tmp/mylogger.json) or in Zookeeper (i.e. zk:log4j2-vds.json).

**`- path <path>`**
