# Sync Identity Linkage across rules

The identity linkage is the criteria that uniquely links a source identity to a target identity. This linkage may be based on a variable (source attribute or local variable), or a combination of information computed with a function. If you want the same identity linkage logic for all rules, check the **Sync Identity Linkage across rules** option. If this is selected, once the identity linkage is defined for one rule, all other rules are based on the same logic. If this is unchecked, each rule can have different identity linkage criteria.
