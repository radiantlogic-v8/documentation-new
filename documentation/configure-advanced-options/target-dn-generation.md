# Target DN Generation

The target DN can be generated automatically or manually. If the **Automatic** option is selected, the target DN is generated by default based on the virtual view created for the target and where it is mounted in the RadiantOne namespace. This works well if you are working with a target naming context that is relatively flat and all objects you are synchronizing are in the same container. If this is not the case, and you need to sync entries into various containers/branches in the target, then choose the **Manual** option. If the **Manual** option is selected, you have a Target DN setting in your Rule where you can select the variable that contains the logic for how the target DN is to be generated. If the **Automatic** option is selected, you do not have this setting for your rules.
