## Data Management APIs

A rich set of HTTP-based API's have been developed on top of LDAP, to provide broader access to the RadiantOne service. 

<section>
  
  > [SCIM](web-services-api-guide/scim)  
  > The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification automates user identity management between identity domains. 
  
  > [REST](/adap)  
  > The REST interface supports all LDAP operations and the ability to navigate the directory tree. Wrapping these operations and the progressive disclosure capabilities that exist in LDAP directories into a REST interface opens it up to the web.
